Personalization usually means trading speed for relevance. With Next.js 15, hyper-fast edge networks, and thoughtful caching, you get both.

1. **Segment once, cache everywhere.** We assign visitors to cohorts with a single edge computation, then cache the resulting payload with the cohort key.
2. **Stream priority content.** Above-the-fold markup ships immediately while we hydrate modules with targeted offers asynchronously.
3. **Instrument the experience.** Every variant logs user journey milestones so we can cycle through experimentation quickly.

> The TL;DR: latency dies when personalization becomes a data problem, not a server-render problem.

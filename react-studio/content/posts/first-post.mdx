Launching a flagship digital product across multiple regions demands more than a feature checklist. We build a single launch blueprint that aligns product, marketing, and operations before a single commit lands on `main`.

## Shared narrative operating system

We codify the brand voice and critical paths into a story framework that every team can reference. This collapses review cycles because *everyone* understands what “on brand” means.

## Integrated instrumentation

Every component ships with analytics hooks, accessibility validation, and performance budgets. It feels slower at first—but it’s how we avoid regressions when releases start accelerating.

```javascript
export function instrument(componentName, payload) {
  queueMicrotask(() => {
    window.analytics?.track(`${componentName}:render`, payload);
  });
}
```

By treating instrumentation as a first-class citizen we keep post-launch sprints focused on growth, not retrofitting telemetry.

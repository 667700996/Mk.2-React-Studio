When teams treat design systems as static asset libraries, velocity stalls. We wire design systems directly into product analytics so they evolve with every release.

- **Design tokens = business levers.** Tie spacing, color, and typography rules to measurable outcomes like readability or task completion.
- **Code + content parity.** MDX-based documentation keeps implementation and narrative in sync.
- **Feedback loops.** Component usage heatmaps tell us which UI patterns actually move the needle.

Design systems are no longer “nice to have” brand work—they are growth accelerants.
